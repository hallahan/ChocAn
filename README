To run the application, make sure that ChocoholicsAnonymous.jar and ChocAnon.db
are in the same directory.  Then simply open ChocoholicsAnonymous.jar

If you wish to compile the source code, make sure that you have added:
	sqlitejdbc-v056.jar ,
	swing-layout-1.0.4.jar
to your project.  This will already be done for you if you pull this repository
from github.

Also, the application should be launched by the main method of Login.class.
The main methods for all of the other classes are used for testing purposes.
